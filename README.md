# GM2 Cipher

GM2 Cipher is a simple web application that allows you to encrypt and decrypt text using the GM2 Cipher algorithm. The GM2 Cipher is a type of Caesar Cipher that works on letters (both upper and lower case) while leaving other characters unchanged.

## Features

- Encrypt text using GM2 Cipher
- Decrypt text using GM2 Cipher
- Upload text files to encrypt or decrypt
- Download encrypted or decrypted text as a .txt file


## How to Use

1. Open the GM2 Cipher in your web browser.
2. Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt in the "Input Text" area.
3. Enter a numeric key in the "Enter Key" input field.
4. Choose the appropriate action (Encryption or Decryption) from the dropdown menu.
5. Click the "Generation" button to perform the action.
6. The result will be displayed in the "Output Text" area.
7. If you want to upload a text file, click the "Upload" button and select the file you want to process.
8. To save the result as a .txt file, click the "Download" button.

## How It Works

The GM2 Cipher algorithm works by shifting each letter in the input text by the specified key value. For example, if the key is 3, every letter 'A' will become 'D', 'B' will become 'E', and so on. Non-letter characters are left unchanged.
